    <h2 class="text-center">Influenza</h2>
    <p style = color:beige class="text-center">
        The flu, short for influenza, is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses. It typically spreads through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. Symptoms often include fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, fatigue, and headache. While most people recover within a week or two, the flu can lead to severe complications, especially in vulnerable populations such as the elderly, young children, and those with underlying health conditions. CDC estimates that flu has resulted in 9.4 million – 41 million illnesses, 100,000 – 710,000 hospitalizations and 4,900 – 52,000 deaths annually between 2010 and 2022.The yearly vaccination remains the best way to prevent the flu and its potentially serious consequences. 
        During flu seasons or when experiencing flu-like symptoms, it's essential to seek testing promptly, especially for those at higher risk of complications. Early diagnosis allows for timely treatment and implementation of preventive measures to reduce the spread of the virus within communities

    <h2 class="text-center">RSV</h2>
    <p style = color:beige class="text-center">
        Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is a prevalent viral infection that primarily impacts the respiratory system, particularly in young children and older adults. It spreads through respiratory droplets expelled when an infected person coughs or sneezes and can persist on surfaces for several hours. Symptoms of RSV often resemble those of a cold, encompassing coughing, sneezing, a runny nose, fever, and, in some cases, wheezing or breathing difficulties, which can be more pronounced in infants and older adults.
        Although most individuals recover from RSV without severe complications, it can lead to significant respiratory issues, particularly in premature infants, older adults, and those with compromised immune systems. Each year the CDC estimates:
        58,000-80,000 hospitalizations among children younger than 5 years old.
        60,000-160,000 hospitalizations among adults 65 years and older.
        6,000-10,000 deaths among adults 65 years and older
        Testing helps guide treatment decisions and implement appropriate infection control measures to prevent the spread of the virus.

    <h2 class="text-center">Covid</h2>
    <p style = color:beige class="text-center">
        COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, emerged in late 2019 and swiftly became a global pandemic. This highly contagious respiratory illness spreads primarily through respiratory droplets when an infected person talks, coughs, or sneezes, and it can also transmit through contact with contaminated surfaces. Symptoms range from mild to severe and can include fever, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, muscle or body aches, loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion, nausea, and diarrhea.
        While most people with COVID-19 experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover without requiring hospitalization, severe cases can lead to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), organ failure, and death, particularly in older adults and those with underlying health conditions. According to the CDC, this illness is much more infectious and deadly compared to the flu where there has been as in between 2020-2022, there were over 300 million confirmed cases worldwide since the start of the pandemic and more than 5 million reported deaths globally due to COVID-19-related complications.
